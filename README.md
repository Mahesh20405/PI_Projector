- Raspbian OS

## Use Cases
- Ideal for schools in rural areas with limited amenities for smart education.
- Enables students to attend live online classes from various resources with a wide range of educational content.
- Availability of internet and wireless connectivity options provide a diverse range of usability in resource-constrained areas.
- Kit-based board setup ensures portability and ease of maintenance supporting mobile classrooms and remote learning initiatives.
- Implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) teaching via camera system enables an immersive learning experience.

## Dependencies
- Standard 5V power supply
- Cost-effective solution compared to traditional smart boards
- Collaboration with local dealers for widespread availability and support
- Access to technical support and maintenance plan
- Stable internet connection for certain functionalities

## Cost Comparison
A basic smart board can cost about 1,45,000 to 2,00,000 Rupees, while our entire system is priced within 50,000 Rupees. Schools and institutions can deploy the system with minimum additional installment expenses.

## Installation and Usage
The whole setup is packed inside a kit shaped like briefcase and it does not require any installation.
